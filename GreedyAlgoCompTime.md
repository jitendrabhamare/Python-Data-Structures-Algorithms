# Greedy Algorithm: Completion Time

Problem Statement
The input file describes a set of jobs with positive and integral weights and lengths. It has the format

[number_of_jobs] </br>
[job_1_weight] [job_1_length]</br>
[job_2_weight] [job_2_length]</br>
...</br>

Aim is to run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs in decreasing order of 
1. The difference (weight - length) </br>

2. The ratio (weight/length) </br>

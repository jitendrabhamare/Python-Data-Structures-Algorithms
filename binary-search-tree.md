***
<ins>**Properties**</ins>
1. Exactly one node per key (value).
2. Each node has 3 attributes
    1. Key (value)
    2. Left Child Pointer
    3. Right Child Pointer
3. For any arbitrary node of a tree, the children in left sub-tree have keys less than the node-key and the children
in the right sub-tree have keys larger than the node key.
